# Ghost Escape

This is a small Unity Game Project I made to understand the workings of the unity build system and setting up analytics to capture game data results for different ghost behavior

## Game Controls
* Movement
    * Keyboard (WASD)
    * Controller (Dpad or Left Stick)
    * Android (On screen Stick)
* Pick up Item
    * Keyboard (E)
    * Controller (South button)
    * Android (On Screen Button section)

## Goal of the game
You are trapped inside a graveyard with a ghost chasing you. Pick up all the keys in order to unlock the exit and escape.


## Project Goals
* Simple Game Loop
* Andriod Build
* x64 Build
* Two variations of ghost behavior for analytics testing
* Run Analytics and Send Data back to dashboard

## Issues Faced
* Android build does not work exactly as expected. touch controls sometimes do not work and the viewport does not align with screen. 
* Analytics documentation is a bit scattered as there are newer versions.
